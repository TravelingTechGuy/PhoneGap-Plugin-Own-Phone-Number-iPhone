h3. iPhone PhoneGap plugin to retrieve own phone number

This project demonstrates how to build and use a simple PhoneGap plugin for iPhone.
The plugin simply returns the phone's number as a string.

Start by creating a "PhoneGap":http://www.phonegap.com project (we assume version >= 1.0.0)

To implement your own plugin, follow these 4 steps:
# *Create the plugin* - add an Objective-C class to the Plugins folder (see *MyPhoneNumberPlugin.h* and *MyPhoneNumberPlugin.m*)
## The class extends the PhoneGap _PGPlugin_ class
## The function you need to implement has this signature _- (void) getMyPhoneNumber:(NSMutableArray*)arguments withDict:(NSMutableDictionary*)options;_
## The _arguments_ array will contain the names of the 2 success and error functions
# *Add to plugins list* - add a value to the Plugins dictionary that includes the name of your class (see *PhoneGap.plist*)
# *Create a JavaScript interface* - implement a JavaScript interface to the plugin (see *myphonenumber.js*)
## Notice that it expects an _oSuccess_ and _onError_ callback functions
## No need for it to be too elaborate - contain your actual logic in the Objective-C code, and any data preparation to the calling function
## There's more than one way to cll the _PhoneGap.exec_ function, apparently. I ended up with this format after a lot of trial and error (I left earlier versions in the file, commented out)
# *Call your plugin* - (see *index.html*)
## include the js file in the HTML head section
## I find it easier to create a single function that contains both _oSuccess_ and _onError_ callback functions, and the actual call

And that's it. Again, if you keep the logic in the actual plugin Objective-C code, you can more or less reuse this framework as is for future plugins.
